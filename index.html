                                <p>Garis and I have worked in many ventures together and his attention to standards, details and quality always astounds me. He thrives to do the things the right way and isn't afraid to speak his mind and coach you through the details when needed. As an Engineer, he delivers innovative business solutions with great quality and quickly moves on to the next item on the backlog. He is fun, dynamic, easy to talk to and always a great asset to any team. If your business is looking for a strong Engineer that can deliver value with a sensitive time to market, without sacrificing security or quality, then he's your guy. I highly recommend Garis for a future Engineering position and hopeful that our paths cross again.</p>

MANIFESTO FOR AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
